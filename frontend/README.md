# React + Vite

Welcome to the Calendar App

–– Start by logging in or registering if you're new. ––

–– Then upload your calendar --

–– Finally, query for availability. You can query someone else to compare your two schedules, or you can query yourself to see your schedule. ––

–– If you want to add your friends to keep track of them, you can do that on the Friends page ––

–– Because this page runs off ai tokens, if the query/upload feature return errors, the website is likely out of tokens. ––
